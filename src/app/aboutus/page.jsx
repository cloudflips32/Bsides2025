          Traditional conferences often come with barriers: cost, exclusivity, or limited speaker slots. BSides flips the script by offering a platform where more voices can be heard, and more people can participate. We're here to celebrate curiosity, encourage growth, and help build a stronger, more resilient security community in Southwest Florida.
