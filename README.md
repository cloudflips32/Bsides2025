## 🔐 Branch Protection Rules (Important)

The `main` branch is protected by a GitHub ruleset. You **cannot push or commit directly to `main`**. All contributions must go through the following process:

- Work from the `staging` branch (or a feature branch created from it).
- Open a **pull request (PR)** into `main` from `staging`.
- Your PR must meet the following requirements:
  - ✅ At least 1 approval from a reviewer
  - ✅ All conversations must be resolved before merging
  - 🚫 Direct commits and force pushes to `main` are blocked
  - ✅ Merge method is limited to **Squash** for a clean history

These rules ensure a safe, organized, and review-driven development process.

---

## 🧑‍💻 How to Contribute

1. **Work on the `staging` branch only.**  
   Do not commit directly to `main`.

2. **Suggested contributions:**

   - Layout and design updates (HTML/CSS/JS)
   - Components for speaker lists, schedules, forms, etc.
   - Branding updates (use the provided logo)

3. **Submit a pull request from `staging` to `main`**  
   Only when you're ready for production review.

## ✅ Commit Guidelines

Use clear and descriptive commit messages like:

- `Add speaker section layout`
- `Style landing page header`
- `Include BSides SWFL logo in assets`

Prefer Conventional Commits:

- `feat(home): add hero section`
- `fix(style): adjust contrast for accessibility`
